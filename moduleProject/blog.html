            <p>Observe blinking. People on their phones generally blink much less than people looking around, and I
                suppose this is due to whether these people are paying attention to the thing they are looking at, but I
                also think interest in what is observed is important. Those go hand in hand you might say, but I think
                there are some distinctions.

                <br>

                For one, sometimes people are paying attention to things because they have to, for example for a job or because it is socially expected they do so. Engagement on the other hand brings about attention, but people who are engaged are paying attention because they want to, not because they have to.
