    <p class="p1">I live in a fairly walkable, but leaving a lot to be desired town by the highway. </p>
    <p class="p1">The area where I live is on the downtrodden side, however there have been nearby development works. </p>
    <p class="p1">There is one station, but it is always busy because of the number of people that live there. </p>
    <p class="p2">There are a number of schools places on opposite sides of the town from each other, making traversal between them annoying but doable. </p>
